## MDDN 242 2023 Assignment 2

 
For my intial sketch I wanted the overlapping and ruggedness of the shapes to shine. 

Each of my letter is created using a large 'base' circle, a triangle and/or a second smaller circle. The 'base' circle is a constant/fixed element. The triangle and/or small circle are controlled by up to 9 parameters (3 parameters for the circle and 6 for the triangle). These paramaters control size and locations of thr shapes.

The parameters used are:
* `size` : radius of the second circle
 * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsetx1` : x offset for the triangles left corner
  * `offsety1` : y offset for the triangles left corner
   * `offsetx2` : x offset for the triangles top point
  * `offsety2` : y offset for the triangles top point
   * `offsetx3` : x offset for the triangles right corner
  * `offsety3` : y offset for the triangles right corner

  I wasn't super happy with this initial idea. This is because it felt very flat and didn't have a lot of character to it. I liked the colour palette, so decided to keep that th same. 

  I didn't want to get too complicated with the shapes I was using, so decided to stay away from custom shapes. In my new idea, I went for what could be described as an art deco inspired typeface. I wanted to create this typeface using shapes that complimented each. For example I have paired the softness of the arc with the harshness (in the egdes) of the triangles.
